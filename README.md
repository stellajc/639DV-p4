# The Sky of US
This is a webpage developed by group T**M (Weijie Chen, Tianyuan Zheng, Zan Zhang, Yu Li) for the group project of CS639 Data Visualization in fall 2020 of UW-Madison. This webpage provides a platform to view the historical flight by airport, airplane and route. This is developed from a public-available flight information dataset from Kaggle and it is inspired by the Flight Patterns work by Aaron Koblin and Flight Path with Edge Bundling by Sophie Engle.
